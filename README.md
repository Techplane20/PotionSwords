# Potion Swords
A simple mod that adds enchantments that cause the target to gain a negative status effect.

# So what exactly does this mod do?
Right now Potion Swords adds 8 enchantments to Minecraft:

Frost, which gives the target slowness

Helium, which gives the target levitation

Sickness, which gives the target hunger and nausea

Dulling Touch, which gives the target Mining Fatiuge

Wither Touch, which gives the target wither similar to a wither skeleton

Poison Touch, which gives the target posion

Blindness Touch, which gives the target blindness

Last but but not least: Weakness Touch which gives the target weakness

Each of these enchantments have one level, which is level three. I did that to confuse people. All of the enchantments are incompatible with Sharpness, Fire Aspect,
Smite, Knockback and Bane of Arthropods. This is to prevent people from making super op swords.
**These enchantments cannot be obtained using the enchantment table. That is on purpose and will not be added later.**

# How can I dowload this?
You can download the mod by going to [releases](https://github.com/Techplane20/PotionSwords/releases) and downloading the latest release.

# How can I help?
The only thing I really need right now is a logo. If you make one, get in touch with me!

# Why are some your commit descriptions emojis?
For the sake of clarity and brevity I sometimes use gitmoji in my commit descreptions. You can find a key to what they mean [here.](https://gitmoji.dev)

# Future Goals/Plans for this mod
I am planning to make a 1.17.x version of the mod, as well as a Curseforge and/or Modrinth page as soon as the mod is out of early access.
Some enchantments also may be made incompatable with one another and crafting recipes will be added to obtain the enchanted books for each enchant.

Minecraft Versions supported: 1.16.5
